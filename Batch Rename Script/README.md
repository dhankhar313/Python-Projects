# Batch Rename Script 

## I use this script to rename multiple episodes of any TV show which contains lots of episodes with varying names like Bluray or 720p or the year of release but for me my preferred format is Friends S01E01.

## Inputs:

### Location : Accepted Formats are D:\Season 1 or D:/Season 1 or D://Season 1

### Param 1 : First parameter like Show name e.g. Friends, can't be blank

### Param 2 : Second parameter like Season number e.g. 01, can be blank

### Param 3: Third paramter like episode number e.g. 01, can't be blank

### Extension: File extension, can't be blank
